# FaceAnime
The source code (pytorch) for our project: Image-to-Video Generation via 3D Facial Dynamics. 

Training & testing datasets.
We use the IJBC video datasets for the training of our generation model. All the images are cropped by the 2DAL algorithm. 
Specifically, the face IDs with poor quality are removed firstly, 2447 video folders are selected for the training & testing. 20 video folders are randomly selected, others are used for training. The training and testing subsets can be downloaded: Baidu Yun.
